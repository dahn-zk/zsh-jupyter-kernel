       "IPython offers a fully compatible replacement for the standard Python\n",

       "* Output caching system:\n",
       "\n",
       "  For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input\n",
       "  cache exists but using _ instead of _i. Only actions that produce a result\n",

       "  Finally, a global dictionary named _oh exists with entries for all lines\n",

       "\n",
